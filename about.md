# FAQ

#### What is this website?

This website serves as a gateway of the SSB network to the traditional internet by exposing the posts on SSB. Unlike the traditional internet, the content on SSB belongs to the authors and is stored in a dectrazlied way. This website only shows a partial snapshot.

#### How can I publish or reply?

As a decentralized network you don't register and you also don't need to use this website. Simply follow [these steps](https://scuttlebutt.nz/get-started/) to start. Your post content will immediately be available on the SSB network. If you also want to see your posts here you can opt in by setting the "publicWebHosting" value as True in your client. We update the website daily and your posts will be hosted within 24h. It should be noted that SSB is at its early stage just like the internet in 1993 or cars in 1900. For example, at the moment people are still working on multiple device support and post edit is still not widely supported. If you prefer a more mature user experience you probably should wait a few more years. If you are a dreamer/inventor/entrepreneur or a person who just likes trying out new things, SSB is your place.


#### What does "%", "@" and "#" standard for?

In SSB each post has a unique identifier started with % such as:

`%lmELhGVLXcWrygyG0whgkzkmjlmiB1jZf5EshQ5zfhs=.sha256`

Posts are published by feeds (mostly human at the moment) and each feed also has a unique identifier started with `@` such as:

`@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519`

The `#` hashtags are channels for discussion. It is not part of the SSB protocol but a convention accepted by popular Apps.
